# The Fast Fourier Transform

This code will perform the Fast Fourier Transform polynomial multiplication
algorithm using vectors of coeffeficients of 2 polynomials of degree n. 

To see just how fast this algorithm is test.py runs a brute force polynomial
multiplication algorithm as well. The script will time the execution time
of both algorithms, and display them. 

If the script argument n is <= 100 the results will output to the screen, otherwise 
they are written to a file and just the run times are printed.

## How to run
`python test.py < n >` 

n = a power of 2
